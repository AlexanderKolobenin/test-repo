Bliss - Donâ€™t Look Back

Don't have to question, everything you feel
It's in your heart, in your mind, in your soul

Not everything you want is what you need
Look inside, look inside and you'll see

(Don't look back) take it easy on yourself
(Don't look back) don't have to worry
(Don't look back) take it easy on yourself
(Don't look back) this time
