Bliss - Don’t Look Back

Don't have to question, everything you feel
It's in your heart, in your mind, in your soul

Not everything you want is what you need
Look inside, look inside and you'll see

(Don't look back) take it easy on yourself
(Don't look back) don't have to worry
(Don't look back) take it easy on yourself
(Don't look back) this time

As we rise, we fall, fall to the ground
But get up, get up, on your feet
And if you look around there's always someone there
Just look up, look up, to the skies

(Don't look back) take it easy on yourself
(Don't look back) don't have to worry
(Don't look back) take it easy on yourself 
(Don't look back) this time

…

(Don't look back)
(Don't look back)
(Don't look back)
(Don't look back)
(As we rise, we fall)
